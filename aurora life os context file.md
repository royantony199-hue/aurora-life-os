# Aurora Life OS - Project Context File

## Vision & Core Concept

**Product Name**: Aurora AI - Your AI Life Operating System

**Core Vision**: An AI that acts as a personal CEO/manager for an individual's life - planning, executing, and optimizing everything from productivity to wellness to habits with emotional intelligence.

**Philosophy**: 
- Internet connected everyone globally
- AI will make individuals independent/self-sustaining again  
- Gap: Need for personal AI managers to orchestrate this independence

## Problem Statement

Most productivity tools:
- Only handle tasks and calendars without understanding emotional context
- Require manual updates and don't proactively guide your day
- Fail to integrate mental wellness and habit change into goal achievement
- Can't autonomously adapt plans based on real-time life changes

## Target Audience
